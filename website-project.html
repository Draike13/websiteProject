            This is a recipe that I had been sent on facebook a couple times. Everytime I saw it pop up the thought would cross my mind..."that's not bad, but could I do it better?"
        <br><br>
        So this is my take on that quick recipe with quite a bit of added flavor.

        <button class="accordion">Instructions</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>
            <h4>*Note*</h4>
            <p class="smallText">The night before making these(or about 4 hours prior at least) take cream cheese and butter out of the fridge to get “aggressively” room temp. We don’t want overly cold creams for this!</p>
            To make the filling place butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on low speed until mostly combined.<br>
            Add the sugar and vanilla to the mixer and bring up the speed to medium to combine while scraping down the sides.<br>
            <p class="smallText">The amount of sugar you add will simply make it sweeter. I prefer these to be more savory so I use one cup. This is the same frosting I use on cakes though and for that I use 2 or more. Whatever you prefer will work fine.</p>
            <h4>*Don’t have a stand mixer? No problem!*</h4>
            <p class="smallText">Do the exact same thing in a LARGE bowel using a hand mixer or very sturdy whisk. I’d recommend adding the sugar slowly with this method, or you will make a mess.</p>
            Next we make the “french toast dip”. Combine all ingredients into a small wide bowl(cake pans work well for this). You need about 1/3 cup of milk per egg in this recipe, and whole milk is always better because of the higher fat content.<br>
            <p class="smallText">Personally I never have whole milk in the house, but I do have heavy cream! A half and half mixture of milk and cream works wonderfully.</p>
            Any combination or fat level of milk/cream will work fine, it will just slightly change how the brown in the pan later.<br>
            Cut your strawberries into thin slices! If you don’t have, or cant get, fresh strawberries that’s fine; frozen are ok too! Just make sure that you thaw them, and DRY them. Moisture is your enemy here. No one wants soggy toast.<br>
            At this point put about a tablespoon and a half of butter in a large pan on medium heat and let it get up to temp.<br>
            Cut the crusts off about 20 slices of bread then roll them flat with a rolling pin(or anything you can smash them with).<br>
            <h3>Now for the assembly:</h3>
            Take a piece of flattened bread and on one of the short sides(it should be sort of rectangular) smear about a teaspoon of cream cheese filling, or however much you can comfortable fit.<br>
            <p class="smallText">Don’t worry, some WILL ooze out, you’ll get the hang out it.</p>
            Take 2-4 pieces of strawberries and place on top of the filling(again whatever will comfortable fit), then roll the bread, filling side tucked in, into a tight cylinder. The rule here is as tight as you can without squishing it.<br>
            Repeat 19 more times! Fun, right?<br>
            Now take 1 roll in your fingers and literally ROLL it through the french toast dip. We aren’t trying to saturate this, just a light coating.<br>
            Once coated put it directly in the hot pan.<br>
            Do that for about half of them, or however many will fit in your pan.<br>
            Leave them for about 3 minutes, or until browning nicely(just lift one slightly to check).<br>
            Now flip them, tongs worked well for me, but use whatever you’re comfortable with.
            <h4>*Going to be very hot at this point*</h4> <p class="smallText">No burnt fingers please, we use tools here!</p>
            Once flipped let them brown for about 2 minutes(it will take less time than the first side due to them already being warm.<br>
            Remove from pan and plate, sprinkle tops with salt if you like them savory.<br>
            Let them sit for a minute or 2, they will leak less.<br>
            Recommended serving toppers would also be powdered sugar or strawberry syrup.

        <p>Peaches!<br><br>
        My mother has always loved peaches, and the best around are from Rendleman farms.<br>
        Personally i've never liked peaches...That is, until I had an idea.<br><br>
        See, in the midwest is always going on about peaches and cream, and i've never understood what the big deal was. But what if we took those simply ingrediants and made something magical out of each of them?<br><br>
        And you know what? Let's serve it on a biscuit!</p>
